# docgenerator

Steps for REST:
1) Design our API 
2) Create OpenAPI spec & store it in root folder of API (link needs to be public)
3) Use DocGenerator to generate doc form spec based on direct link
3) Start coding based on the spec
4) If we already have old API then we can create spec file with Swagger Converter or other tools.
